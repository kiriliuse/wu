Since the service is practically capped with the prices that they can earn with a single meal saved they can only meaningfully increase revenue by saving more meals. And what a successful marketing they have. TooGoodToGo is an ever-growing service which has increased it's yearly saved meal count from 52 million to 78 Million (+50%) and reached 20 million additional users within 2022 [1]. But how did they manage such a marketing feat?</p> <p>TooGoodToGo is in a challenging situation since they cannot invest huge amounts of capital into marketing. Therefore they have to work with low-budget marketing channels such as stickers and branded paper bags. These are low-cost and still promote the brand at key points in the decision making of customers. Another way in which they excel is in media coverage. The company and it's services have received more than 25.000 media occurrences [1]. A major part of their marketing channel management is mouth-to-mouth marketing. Since perfectly good food at a fraction the price is a topic which is interesting to virtually everyone this mode of marketing works exceptionally well for TooGoodToGo.</p> <p>One more interesting aspect is the diversification of products in different countries. Since they operate in 17 countries [1] and each country is different they need a more diverse product portfolio. Not only the Magic Bags where most meals are saved directly from restaurants are a success. Also the recent Magic Parcels target a different part of the food supply chain in that they aim to reduce the waste already in the production or preparation of food by targeting ingredients. To complete the product range they have 2 services targeted at resellers. FoodMemo is handling out-of-date times of various products and helps businesses with forming better decisions about their stock of foods while the often good for longer stickers signal to customers that this product can be consumed oftentimes beyond the run-off date. [1]</p> <p>The ongoing growth of TooGoodToGo is likely to continue since there is still a great potential in this market. Food waste is not just a pressing issue of society as a whole but also a lucrative business endeavor for all participants. First off there are still a lot more countries to expand to. France alone accounts for almost 60% of sales which all other 16 countries share 40% of meals saved [1]. Also more stores and restaurants have are continuously signing up and therefore there is still great potential even within well-established countries.</p>"},{"location":"Too%20Good%20To%20Go%20Case%20Study/#todo-incorporate-survey-from-gdrive-from-pave","title":"todo incorporate survey from gdrive from @pave","text":""},{"location":"Too%20Good%20To%20Go%20Case%20Study/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<p>[1] Annual Report TooGoodToGo GmbH https://tgtg-mkt-cms-prod.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/40102/ImpactReport2022_DE.pdf</p>"},{"location":"Too%20Good%20To%20Go%20Case%20Study/#notes","title":"Notes","text":"<ul> <li>17 countries</li> <li>not only reduction of waste through normal magic boxes</li> <li>FoodMemo, software to monitor the out-of-date times of products</li> <li>Magic Parcels saving already the ingredients in the production</li> <li>Often good for longer stickers - found on store bought products</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Trade%20and%20Globalization/","title":"Trade and Globalization","text":"<p>source: https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization</p>"},{"location":"Trade%20and%20Globalization/#trade-and-globalisation-our-world-in-data","title":"Trade and Globalisation \u2013 Our World In Data","text":"<p>Over the last two centuries trade has grown remarkably completely transforming the global economy.      \u2022 Exports today are more than 40 times larger than in 1913.

Competition - Firms are forced to innovate and cut costs to avoid being replaced by more dynamic firms.     2. Economies of scale \u2013 Firms that export worldwide face larger demand which allows them to operate at a larger scale.     3.

Rural regions experienced a slower decline in poverty and had lower consumption growth. This showed the gains from trade are unequally distributed. Although trade negatively affects wages and employment for specific groups of people, it also brings welfare gains with the prices of consumption goods from product variety.      \u2022 Study from Mexico showed arrival of global retail chains led to reductions in the incomes of retail sector workers as well as lower costs of living for both rich and poor households. Thus, concluding a net positive welfare across all income groups (con: regressive) Conclusion: There are aggregate gains from trade, but there are also real distributional concerns. While it isn\u2019t a major driver of income inequality, public policies, such as unemployment benefits and other safety-net programs, should help redistribute the gains from trade.</p>"},{"location":"Trade%20and%20Globalization/#trade-from-a-historical-perspective","title":"Trade from a historical perspective","text":"<p>There have been two waves of globalization.      \u2022 The first wave \u2013 from the 19th century to the beginning of the First World War.     \u2022 Openness Index \u2013 Ratio of total trade (I + X) to global GDP     \u2022 Never exceeded 10% before 1800 (mostly driven by colonialism)     \u2022 Technological advances (ex- steamships) triggered a period of growth in world trade which came to an end with the First World War, when the decline of liberalism and the rise of nationalism led to a slump in international trade.     \u2022 The second wave - after the Second World War and is continuing.     \u2022 Openness Index amounts to more than 50% today.     \u2022 This rapid growth was enabled by reduction in transaction costs from technological advances such as: commercial civil aviation, telephone, sea freight.      \u2022 This did not only impact trade volume but also the types of goods traded.

Trade in goods has been happening for millennia, while trade in services is a relatively recent phenomenon. Today, services are an important driver of trade in some countries (UK- services are about 45% of all exports.).  Globally, trade in goods accounts for most trade transactions. But the share of services in total global exports has increased (17% in 1979 to 24% in 2017) Today, about 30% of the value of global exports comes from foreign inputs. This is a key indicator of global economic integration in which we see the different stages of the production process taking place across different countries. Bilateral trade has grown substantially (13.05% in 1950 to 57.76 in 2014) as well as the number of preferential trade agreements (a pact that reduces tariffs for participants). In the late 1970s, North-South agreements accounted for more than half of all agreements. Today, most preferential trade agreements are between developing economies.     \u2022 Up until the Second World War, most of trade transactions were between a small group of rich countries. This regime has changed over the last couple of decades, and today trade between non-rich countries is just as important as trade between rich countries.</p>"},{"location":"Trade%20and%20Globalization/#explaining-trade-patterns","title":"Explaining trade patterns","text":"<p>Most trade theories focus on sources of comparative advantage. A country is said to have a comparative advantage if they can produce something at a lower opportunity cost than their trade partners.  These theories suggest that all nations can gain from trade if each specializes in producing what they are relatively more efficient at producing, based on their strengths.     \u2022 Trade patterns of Japan from closed to open economy:  Prices of major exports like silk increased (Cheap to produce for Japan and was valuable abroad) while prices of imports like sugar decreased (Cheap abroad, difficult to produce locally). Trade intensity is strongly linked to geographic distance. Findings suggests that trade diminishes with distance, thus making it a significant barrier to trade. This is further proven by looking at trade intensity data within countries. Firms exporting to each of the corresponding neighbours is largest close to the border. Empirical evidence shows that comparative advantage is indeed relevant; but it is not the only force driving incentives to specialization and trade. Taking the concept of comparative advantage, why is it then the case that in the last few years we have seen such rapid growth in intra-industry trade between rich countries? Increasing returns to scale has been used to explain the rapid growth of this phenomena (Evenett and Keller). The idea is that specialization allows countries to reap greater economies of scale (i.e. to reduce production costs by focusing on producing large quantities of specific products), so trade can be a good idea even if the countries do not differ in factor endowments.</p>"},{"location":"Trade%20and%20Globalization/#measurement-and-data-quality","title":"Measurement and Data Quality","text":"<ul> <li>Discrepancies in international trade statistics are large for a variety of reasons like: conceptual inconsistencies across measurement standards, inconsistencies in the way countries apply agreed protocols. rest of this section I think is useless for the exam</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Transformations%20of%20Graphs/","title":"Basic laws","text":"<ul> <li>$f(x) + c$ ... move along by $c$ units along y axis</li> <li>$f(x + c)$ ... move along by $c$ units along x axis (inversed)</li> <li>$c*f(x)$ ... stretch ($c&gt;1$) (or compress $1 &gt; c &gt; 0$) vertically or flip it along x-axis ($c &lt; 0$)<ul> <li>this can also shift along y-axis </li> <li>$f(x) = sin(x) + 3)$ has its center value at 2 ($2 &lt; f(x) &lt; 4$)</li> <li>$g(x) = 2 * f(x)$ has its center value at 6 ($4 &lt; f(x) &lt; 8$)</li> </ul> </li> <li>$f(c*x)$ ... compress ($c &gt; 1$) (or stretch $1 &gt; c &gt; 0$) vertically or flip it along y-axis ($c &lt; 0$)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Turning%20Rich%20or%20Becoming%20King/","title":"Turn Rich","text":"<ul> <li>[[Profit Maximization]]</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Turning%20Rich%20or%20Becoming%20King/#become-king","title":"Become King","text":"<ul> <li>become a market leader</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Turning%20Rich%20or%20Becoming%20King/#purpose","title":"Purpose","text":"<ul> <li>why should the company exist?</li> <li>purpose-driven companies stay in business for longer and make more money than get-rich schemes</li> </ul>"},{"location":"USP/","title":"USP","text":"<p>Unique Selling Proposition Unique Selling Point</p> <p>What sets you apart from other competitors</p>"},{"location":"Ultimatum%20Game%20Experiment/","title":"Ultimatum Game Experiment","text":"<p>The subjects are paired</p> <p>One subject gets 100 Bucks, this subject may share some money with the other subject.</p> <p>If the other subject accepts the split, it will happen.
