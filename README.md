Everything so far I have done during the Bachelors Degree of Business and Economics @WU Vienna

## Obsidian
I am making most of my notes publicly available. 

Feel free to contribute or even do some of my todos (like copying images from slides). Open a pull request and I am more than happy to review the changes.

Place all images and other non-markdown files into the folder `/attachments` for easy reference.

I personally use obsidian, but you can use any Markdown Editor you want. Just view (and edit) the markdown files on Github or clone the repository using `git clone` and get started editing.
## R & nix

R is a statistical programming language heavily relying on arrays and pure functions.

Nerdy Linux stuff ahead - you have been warned!

For creating the R environment using nix run `nix develop` in the project root.

Then execute the files using the `justfile`
