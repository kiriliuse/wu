please use https://github.com/maixnor/wu-quartz instead for the obsidian vault (also know as quartz).

# All things Code at WU

Everything so far I have done (coding wise) during the Bachelors Degree of Business and Economics @WU Vienna.

Basically everything which is not my obsidian vault (wu-quartz) is in here.

# R & nix

R is a statistical programming language heavily relying on arrays and pure functions.

>Nerdy Linux stuff ahead - you have been warned! 

Nix can be used on Windows through WSL or on MacOs using nix-darvin. Not recommended for most people

For creating the R environment using nix run `nix develop` in the project root.

Then execute the files using the `justfile`
