# Triangular Relationship
- [[Financial Statement]]
- [[Balanche Sheet]]
- [[Profit Loss Statement]]

# Equity
- Covering losses
- What owners and stock holders have contributed

# Exceptions to triangular relationships
- depreciation, not in Cash Flow
- non-cash changes in provisions
  - pension schemes (after 10 years)
- "dirty" changes to equity i.e. booked directly into equity

# Provision 
Provision = RÃ¼ckstellung
# Value of Assets in Balance Sheet
- only in balance sheet the value of purchase
- not market value
## Fair Value
- Market value may be used
- Cause of [[Financial Crisis 2008]]
  - Inflation of Balance Sheet
  - When sold at less than book value depreciation kills the company if severe enough

# Financial Accounting
- How are things right now?
- Published to stakeholders and government bodies

# Managerial Accounting
- Why are things like they are
- Not published -> Secrets are in there

# finance analysis
- FTX Crash due to no finance people being present in the company

# Ratios
- e.g. EBIT
- information condensed into simple values
- better to compare business models instead of ratios
- seasonality (compare peak to peak, etc)
- [[Performance Measurement Systems]]
- communicate which ratios are used to assess performance -> mitigating [[Communication Problems]]
- projections are not predictions
- Benchmarks, Benchmarks, Benchmarks
  - industry leaders
  - past 10 years
  - other competitors

## Supplier Loans
- hard time paying during peak times
- giving out a better/later payment scheme
- collect some 2% value (cheaper than bank)

## Short Term Liquidity
- Working Capital - Money on the move. One cannot calculate with these funds, Inventories, Interesting with Production Companies

## Long Term Solvency

## Profitability Ratios
- return on sales i.e. double sales should lead to double profit
  - reaction: look at cost analysis, don't fire people
  - why is it? Not only: how is it?
- ROI
  - when is my investment amortized

## Market Price and Dividend Ratios

# Cash Convertion Cycle
- measurement of money on the move
- 3 parts
- DSO = Days Sales stays outstanding
  - how long to collect the money from their customers
- DIO = Days Inventory stays outstanding
  - how long to sell inventory
- DPO = Days Payables stays outstanding
  - how long to pay for liabilities 
- CCCs
  - DSO + DIO + DPO

CCC can also be negative 
  -> enormous pressure from large suppliers with huge payment Windows
  -> ethical questions with extreme cost cutting in e.g. Fashion Branche
  -> pre-orders: using the customers money to finance the activity 

Performance is contextual.
