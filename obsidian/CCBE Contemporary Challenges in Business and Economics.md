## Part 2 - Problems
### Environmental Destruction
- The Great Accelerations
	- everything is growing expentially
	- good as bad equally
- great achievements in global quality of life
- significant accelrators
	- industrial revolution -> fossil-based fuels
	- welfare capitalism -> mass production for mass consumption
	- China and India rising
- consequences
	- rising mean temperature
		- 2023: highest ocean temperature record (bad)
		- 2023: hottest day record
		- 2023: antarctic sea-ice extent lower than usual
	- point-of-no-return might be closer than thought
	- more droughts, more heat
		- positive feedback loops
	- mass-migration because of
		- degration of water
		- degration of food
	- disasters happen more frequency
		- natural and man-made (e.g. wars)
		- total 28.3 million people
- [[Great Decoupling]] vs [[Great Collapse]]
	- signes for both, cannot differenciate
	- by 2050 things will be clear
	- cannot predict the future yet, can just talk about probabilities
- there is still hope, it is still a challenge, not a problem

### Globalization
- strong connection between Europe, Asia, and Northern America
- everything is interconnected
- low-income countries are most affected regarding Covid regeneration

### Poverty
- extreme poverty has declined globally
	- decreased from 28% to 11%
	- 1.7 billion to 767 million
- enrollment rates in primary schools increased 
	- girl enrollment has risen significantly
- after Covid, more people in extreme poverty than before
	- poorer countries hit most
- extreme income distribution in developing countries
	- brazil has most extreme distribution
- relative income gain (compared to 1988)
	- elephant curve
	- best for middle class
	- upper middle class -> no difference
	- top 1% with great improvements
 - absolute income gain 
	 - best for top 5%
	 - top 30% get 70% of all gains
- rise of income inequality
	- greatest in united states
	- next up UK, then France
- consequences of inequality
	- people move towards better opportunities
	- more refugees
	- massive social costs


Challenge:
balance high income and with with while staying within the boundaries that the earth can provide for a given country

## A Tiny Introduction to Economics
Macroeconomics ... using statistics to understand reality
Microeconomics ... looking at specific groups and their decisions
### Definition
>The study of how society makes choices in managing its scarce resources and the consequences of this decision-making

Issues like
- scarcity and choice
- trade-offs and [[Opportunity Cost]]
- marginal thinking ([[Marginal Changes]])
- incentives and reaction to them

Scope:
- which policy measures recude unemployment?
- how should central banks conduct monetary policy?
- how can we aviod that firms pollute the environment?
- why do people become criminals?

### Examples

#### The impact of legalized abortion on crime.

Theory: With legalized abortion the crime rate decreases because the people that are not born, would later in life become a criminal with a higher chance. 

Great example because:
- a lot of variability for 50 different states
- a lot of data on other aspects of this problem 

#### Oil and the duration of dictatorships

Theory: Dictators with a lot of natural resources should have longer duration in their dictatorships, since they have more resources to burn through to keep the people happy.

#### Up or Down? Toilet Seat Etiquette

a mathematical system about if it is worth it to always put down the toilet seat after peeing.

#### On the efficiency of ACDC

- Bon Scott had a nice voice which was the signature part of the band
- Bon Scott died of alcohol
- They found Brian Johnson, a very similar voice
- huge controversy about who was the better vocalist

They did:
- played an [[Ultimatum Game Experiment]]
- game was played in 2 rooms separately
	- one room played music from Bon Scott
	- one room played music from Brian Johnson
- Scoring: Which got more total income (accepted offers) 
- Brian Johnson Music won

## Scarcity and Choice
- economic activity: interaction between households and frims
- households cannot meet all wants and needs
- scarcity: society has limited resources, cannot meet all needs of all people
- how to best allocate resources for best meeting of needs/wants

## Trade-Offs
- trading off benefits/costs of options
- at societal level are different trade-offs

## Marginal Thinking
Revenue $R(x)$ and Costs $C(x)$

let profit be a function:
$\pi (x) = R(x) - C(x)$

then we can maximize the function (derivative = 0)
$\frac{d\pi (x)}{dx} = \frac{dR (x)}{dx} - \frac{dC (x)}{dx} = 0$

This model requires *rationality* of all participants.

Marginal Quantities: When changing the inputs a little, how does the output change.

Finding a way that the marginal revenue matches their marginal costs. Then their profit is maximized.

## Abstraction and Mathematics
#todo get quotes from slides

Economics often use abstract models, often in mathematical form.

Advantages:
- transparent language for results and benchmarks
- allowing a (hopefully) straightforward way to confront the theoretical results with empirical evidence through predictions 

Role Model of Physics:
- when throwing a fall off a building, what is the speed after 3 seconds?
- Physics has no problem with using wrong model
- the problem with this model is air friction
- It doesn't matter in our model, because it is negligible
- Economics wants to do it like that
	- a lot of abstractsion
	- a lot of assumptions, to keep complexity down
	- question: did I abstract and assume the correct things?

Problem of social sciences:
- Impossible (or at least very hard) to conduct experiment

The Toolbox of an economics:
- empiricism
- rationalism
- deduction
- induction

## Popper  Logic
Science vs Pseudo-Science

For something to be scientific it needs to be 2 things
- logically consistent
	- if it rains, the floor gets wet
- needs to be falsifiable
	- theory: all swans are white
	- how to falsify: find a non-white swan
	- if I can't find a white swan
		- "I cannot falsify the theory yet"
		- but the theory is not proven

## Cause and Effect
Pattern Matching is used to derive insights from data.

Then we search for causality and implications of this patterns 

## Positive vs Normative Analysis
- Why is unemployment higher for teenagers than older workers?
- What should the government do to improve the well-being of teenagers?

Positive Statement ... Can be falsified ... scientific statements
Normative Statement ... includes opinints ... cannot be tested

Positive and Normative tend to get mixed up.

## Critical Thinking
6 rules of evidental reasoning (Lett, 1990)
- Falsifiability
- Logic
- Comprehensive
- Honesty
- Replicability
- Sufficiency
#todo get rest from slides

## Occam's Razor
When there are 2 hypotheses that explain the situation equally well, then choose the simpler one.

## Logical Fallacies
- Ad hominem
	- oh no, that guy is a nazi, therefore the statement must be wrong
- Arguument from authority
- Appeal to ignorance
- Post hoc, ergo propter hoc
	- just because one thing happened after another doesnt mean, that they cause each other

# Globalization
## Roadmap
Why trade?
- production possibility frontier
- principle of comparative advantage
- winners and losers of trade

- trade, globalization and economic development
- trade, globalization and inequality
- trade, globalization and the environment

## History of Globalization
from [ourworldindata.org](ourworldindata.org)
#todo get image from slides

Measurement of "Openness" of a country: Exports + Imports over GDP

## Production Possibility Frontier
Ultra-Simplification of Reality
#todo get image from slides

2 different products (ice crean & shoes, potatoes & meat)

The curve signals the maximum amount of goods you can produce with the amount of resources (labour, capital, land, knowledge). The resources stay constant. Decision on how much of which I want to produce.

A great visualization of scarcity. 

A point:
 - on the curve: efficent
 - inside the curve: not efficent
 - outside the curve: unattainable

Shape of the curve:
how much do I have to sacrifice in my current product, so that I can produce 1 more unit of the other product
- straight
	- sacrifice stays constant (1:1)
- convex (outward)
	- products profit from being produced together
- concave (inward)
	- products do not profit from being produced together

## Principle of Comparative Advantage
- Mark can produce a lot of Meat 
- Pete can produce a lot of Potatoes
#todo get image from slides

Mark has an [[Absolute Advantage]] on Meat, Pete on Potatoes.

Mark should produce only Meat and Pete should only produce Potatoes. 
Then they can trade the excess. 

#todo insert image from 2023-10-17 from lecture

There is a natural incentive for both Mark and Pete. They can, while splitting production and specializing, achieve previously unattainable amounts.

What if Mark is better at everything, has an [[Absolute Advantage]] on both Meat and Potatoes. btw, Production Frontiers can be nested within each other.

#todo get the numbers from slide about gardener/farmer

As long as you are *relatively better* (not absolutely better), you should specialize and engage in trade.

## International Trade & Economic Development

#todo get image from slides
Countries that trade more are more likely to have a greater increase in GDP per capita. Form just this chart we cannot exterpolate the causality relationsship; which cause causes which effect. 

## Critisism
#todo get from slides

## Winners and Losers of Trade
- importing country: domestic consumer better off
- exporting country: domestic consumer worse off
- trade may produce winners and losers, even if the global economy benefits
- benefits of trade
	- increased variety of goods
	- lower unit costs -> economy of scale
	- increased competition
	- enhanced flow of ideas
- trade may increase within-country inequality while generating economic growth

# Globalization | An introduction
- what is globalization?
- enablers of globalization
	- first and second unbundling
- loosers of globalization and "political countermovements"
	- who wins/loses from second unbundling
	- political countermovements
	- the end of [[Hyperglobalization]]?

### What is?
#todo get quotes from slides

### The cost of overcoming distance
- With increased technology the "size" of the world devreases
#todo get image from slides
- time-space compression
- faster turnover time
- capitalism causes the geographical expansion
### Enablers of Globalization
After @Baldwin:

3 constraints:
- Goods Trade Costs
- Communication Costs
- Face-to-Face Costs

Steam revolution decreased goods trade costs
Information and communication revolution decreased communication costs

#### Pre-Globalized World
- high trade cost
- high comms cost
- high f2f cost
Leading to:
- workers and consumers needed to live close by
- very expensive to import/export goods
- local monopolies (cost was still lower than transportation cost)
- limits the size of the market (no [[Economy of Scale]])

### First Unbundling (Steam Revolution)
started in 1820 until 1940 (paused because of WW2)

lower transporation costs lead to:
- geographic expansion, decreased cost of overcoming distance
- turn-over times of capital increase
- quasi-local monopolies disappear
- global markets -> mass produciton
- still high comms and f2f costs

Resulting in:
- Global
	- [[global north]] specialize in manufactured goods
	- [[global south]] specialize in primary commodities, food products
	- division of labour
	- the great [[Divergence]]
	- india/china/africa loose
	- europe, and later USA, win
- cities specialize in production of particular commodities
- knowledge and information remains in the cities and factories of the global north

### Beyond the first unbundling
Many problems still
- econoomic
- political
- socaial
- cultural
- environmental
- innovation
- urbanization 
- trade policies
- slavery
- gunboat diplomacy

general process and contingent historical-geographic factors combine to tell a causal story

## Rebundling (World Wars) (second unbundling)
- world wars put a stop on global trade and integration
- increased fees, focusing on domestic market

- different parts can be produced in different sites

started after 1945
- improvements in transportation
- lower comms cost -> global division of labour
- increases turnover time
- faster product life cycles (e.g. fast fashion)

information and knowledge flow between companies and between [[global north]] and [[global south]].

#### Transportation Tech
- commercial jet aircraft
	- took off (pun unintended) in 1950s
- containerization 
	- enabled mass-transportation
	- incredibly cheap transport costs

#### Shift in Production
Tasks, Products, Assembly is split onto many different people/companies
not a single producer of e.g. airplanes or phones

### Comms Technology
- Satellite and optical fiber technology
- The internet
- Mobile Communication
- Electronic mass media (TV, Radio)
- Intellectual property rights

## A third unbundling?
Face-to-Face Costs remain high

- tacit (non-codified) information exchange is still geographically restricted
- high-tech, financial, and creative industries -> expert industries
	- e.g. Hollywood in LA

### Current World
- low trade barriers
- low transport costs (first unbundling)
- low comms cost (second unbundling)
-> extremely complex global value chains
-> complex global divions of labour based on job and task outsourcing

# Losers of Globalization
### Task outsourcing
- old: All steps of the production by one company
- new: Many steps are delegated (offshored) to other companies

### Stolper-Samuelson (1941)
Elephant Curve #todo get from slides
- string re-distributive implications of free trade models
- model predicts, that unskilled workers will be worse off
- establishes *absolute* losses, not relative losses

### Rodriks additions
- There re loosers from trade
- winners need to compensate the loosers
- redistribution is flipside
- #todo get more from slides

#### Empirical Studies
- #todo get from slides

# Countermovements
- anti-globalization protests
- economic outcomes are linked to political processes
- string political reation to increasion precarization
- job insecurity, competion in the labor market

### Reactions and its Manifestations
- populist voting
- #todo what the fuck did I do here?
- Left or Right?
	- link to welfare state
	- right wing: if generous and open to all residents 
		-> turns against immigration 
	- left wing: if limited to a few market insiders 
		-> turns against EU, WTO, global finance

### Polanyi's double movement
- #todo get image from slides
- Golden straigt jacket: you have to conform to golden role-model
- betton woods compromise: after ww2
- global governance: every person (globally) has a vote (also the [[global south]])

### Backlash
- Rodriks suggests a political backlash
- #todo what should I put here?

- split is more about cultural lines, less about economic lines

### What now?
- have we reached peak globalization?
- no more increase in globalization after 2008

### Key Changes
- similarity to cold war: economic superpowers are fighting over geopolitical power
- "value" of trade is not juts measured by efficiency/profit/revenue but also by e.g. environmental aspects
- move to circular economies / local trade relations -> less emissions
- democracy and market based economies not defined by international law
  -> every country can choose for themselves
- #todo get the end of "in-China for China" from Slides
- stronger focus on "strategic autonomy" and "de-coupling/de-risking" and technological sovereignity
	- chips being produced in EU
	- server farms being built in EU
- China is not just a competitor, but a geopolitical adversary
	- China has almost-monopoly on raw resources for high-tech products (chips, batteries)

### Standard Economic Theory
- helps us understand
	- benefits of trade
	- winners and losers of globalization
	- leads to productivity/efficiency gains
- rarely includes political backlashes etc
	- maybe higher efficiency per company
	- but lower efficiency on marco/global level
- #todo get the rest from slides

# Economic approaches and socio-economics
- What should economics focus on?
- What can different approaches contribute?
- Why socio-economics?

#todo get table from slides

## Mainstream Economics
- neoclassical economics
	- scarcity
	- trade-offs
	- marginal thinking
	- incentives
- mathematical models
	- abstraction
	- assumptions
	- relationships
- postivist view
	- positive statements
	- can be tested, confirmed
	- read off "reality" from empirical facts

Advantages:
- rigorous and transparent language
- results and benchmarks
- check, wether knowledge claims are logically consistent
- identify assumptions necessary to obtain a particular outcome

But:
- based on a particular theory of science, logical positivism
- other approaches: 
	- critical realism
	- hermeneutics
- often less focus on 
	- falsification
	- status of empirical facts
	- importance on "positionality" of researcher

### How to make sense of reality?
 #todo get from slides

### Theoretical lenses
#todo get from slides

## Socioeconomics
- Multi-Disciplinary and Muti-Perspective thinking
- The economy is not an independant entity separate from society
- all decisions have **political** and **moral** results
- actors do not have a level playing field
- markets without **regulations** and **instituations** would destruct society
- economic explanations cannot be reduced to single individuals

## Trade and Growth
Correlational Effect clearly present
[[Prebish-Singer Hypothesis]]
Causal effect of trade and growth -> [[Instrumental Variable Estimation]]
[[Stolper-Samuelson Theorem]]

### Environmental Depletion
- more trade requires more depletion for transportation
- as countries grow richer they tend to get less pollutend
- empirical data for both sides is present
	- neither direction is proven/can be proven currently
- pollution haven
	- pollution without large fees
	- not enough empirical data to see if that happens
	- companies which offshore product seem to be cleaner than domestic producers
