# The Basics
> No-one can "opt out" of economic issues and decisions. Our only options are to be informed, uninformed, or misinformed

&amp; Thomas Sowell, Basic, Economics, 2015

### Econimic Thinking
- What do I need/want
	- not enough thought about why one wants 
- FOMO influences buying decisions
- What are my options?
	- not researching other offers
	- what are the costs (including [[Opportunity Cost]]) and benefits of different options
- What are the consequences of my choises
	- myself, others, enviroment

FOMO ... fear of missing out
# Risk
Risk Management = identification, evaluation and prioritization of [[Risks]]

### Risk Treatment
- avoidance
- reduction (optmizie, mitigate)
- sharing (outsource or insure)
- retention (accept and budget)

![[Businesses]]

### Risk Awareness
Potential loss and threat, but also potential gain and chance

![[Risks#Sources of Risks]]

# Market
### Marketing
> the activity, set of institutions, and process for creating, communicating, delivering and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.

&amp; www.ama.org

> marketing as an ongoing management process that aims at identifying the (potential) customer's needs and wants, developing the product(s) and product features accordingly and communicating the products and their benefits to the (potential) customers.

&amp; @Fuhrmann

Some think marketing is a philosophy that is present in the whole business.

Marketing is about creating value for the customer through
- customer satisfaction
- creating a Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
- gaining and maintaining market share
- maintaining or increasing sales
- profitability -> higher ROI than interest rate

Case Study [[Do&Co during the Pandemic]]

### Market Orientation
> Even if you are not in sales, you are in sales

&amp; my dad

Market Orientation is about knowing the wants and needs of your customers and providing goods or services to meet those wants and needs or even requirements.

### Marketing Mix
- Product: which products and services
- Price: are sold at what price
- Place: where is it available
- Promotion: what is the message
all of this is based on [[Market Research]]

### Market Measures

|                | Volmue        | Potential        |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| All businesses | Market Volume | Market Potential |
| One Business   | Sales Volume  | Sales Potential  |

- Market Share
- Measurement Criteria
- Market Segments
- Market Growth/Decline
- Trends
- Competitors

# Finances
### Liquidity and Sufficient Financial Resources
- Do I have enough cash (or equivalents)
- Can I repay my debts

- Short term assets and liabilities
- Working capital = current assets - current liabilities

- current ratio (working capital ratio): current assets / current liabilities
	-> should be between 1.5 and 2
- [[Acid Test]] ratio: (current assets - stocks) / current liabilities
- positive [[Cash Flow]]
- [[EBIT]] is important

### Sufficient Financial Resources
- Businesses need money for their activities
- Initial capital needs to be present
- #todo get additinal points from slides

### Hyrid [[Bond]]
- Combination of a [[Bond]] and a [[Share]]
- Borrower receives money
- Investor receives shares of the business and
- Investor receives interest
- Similar to Liquid Bonds -> [[Bond]] first, converted to [[Share]] after

### Equity and Debt Finance
- Equity finance
	- fund provided by investors
	- share capital
	- retained earnings (interest)
	- mostly not repayed directly
- debt finance
	- short term credit (bank overdraft, trade credit)
	- long term credit (bank loan, bonds)

### Internal sources of finance
- retained profit
- reduce working capital
- sale of assets

### External sources of finance
- long term
	- share capital
	- loan capital
	- venture capital
- short term
	- bank overdraft / bank loan
	- trade credit
	- leasing
	- [[Debt Factoring]] (selling your trade receivable)

### Examining Stability and Wealth of a Business
- [[Equity]] is very important
- [[Equity#Equity Ratio|Equity Ratio]] important as well
- Wealth is sufficient to sustain the business

### Share vs Venture Capital
- [[Share Capital]] is usually not repaid
	- dividends are used more often
	- rise in stock price is also used for compensation
	- long-term or permanent capital
- [[Venture Capital]] are repaid
	- investments in small businesses (mostly startups)
	- after 5-7 years it is usually paid back (if company still exists)

### Share vs Bond
- [[Share]] rather volatile
- [[Bond|Bonds]] are more stable, yet potentially less profitable
- if the company goes bankrupt, holders of a [[Bond]] are repaid before holders of a [[Share]]

### Choise of Source of Finance
depends on cust, use of funds, financial situation and status/size of business

#todo get rest from slides
### Cost Awareness
Cost-Unaware businesses can be endangered greatly by rising costs or falling sales. They may not be able to adjust their cost management quickly enough to meet the new requirements. 

Why is it important to know your costs?
- decide on starting your business
	- will you be ever able to cover all your costs?
- decide on expanding your business/production
- decide on the opportunity cost being worth it

Why is it important to know the **nature** of your costs
- increased output -> not all costs scale equally
- [[Fixed Costs]] vs [[Variable Costs]]

### Break-Even Analysis
- total costs = total revenues
- minimum output a company needs to meet
- #todo get more from slide 53

Weaknesses
- Assumption that all output is sold
- does not account for change in costs
- some [[fixed costs]] are stepped (e.g. insurance)
- difficult to allocate allocate [[fixed costs]] for a range of products.

### [[Compound Interest]]
Interest on Interest
Exponential Growth

### Funds
A [[Fund]] is a collection of Stocks, therefore the risk is lower than 
picking stocks yourself.

### Soft Euro
USD stays the same. EUR drops. 
Therefore... more EUR for the same amount of USD

People that receive USD and give away EUR benefit the most.

# Profitablity

Profitability Metrics gain in value if you compare them across larger time spans and across different companies in the same industry.
e.g. Return on Equity for just a single year will only tell so much about a company.

#todo get more from slides or just google definitions
### EBITDA

### EBITDA-margin

### EBIT

### Return on Equity
ROE 
(profit before tax ant interest) / equity
### Return on capital employed
ROCE
(profit before tax and interest) / (total capital employed)
### Return on net assets
(profit before tax and interest) / (assets - long-term liabilities)

### Profitability of Startups
- Profitability may be low or even negative
- Growth is more important than profits
- Dependent on external financing
	- should external financing stop, difficult situation
- Liquidity still important

# Accounting
Keeping track of money.
### Types of Accounting
- Cost 
	- Kostenrechnung basically
- Managerial
	- prodividing information for the management 
- Financial 
	- external decision makers
		- Tax authorities
		- investors
		- banks
		- b2b partners
- Auditing
	- reviewing the accuracy of financial reports

### Financial Statement
- balance sheet
	- [[Assets]]
	- [[Liablities]]
	- [[Equity]] ([[Liquidity]])
- income statement
	- revenues
	- costs and expenses
- cash flow statement
	- cash flowing in
	- cash flowing out

# Personnel / Human Resources
People matter. They make the difference between a failing, a good and an amazing company.

### Main Managerial Functions
#todo get more from slides
- Planning
	- settings goals
	- developing strategies
- Organizing
	- structure
	- tasks
	- resources
- Leading
	- vision of business
	- explaining routines
	- motivate people
	- clarify processes, policies
- Controlling
	- measuring performance

### Tasks of HR
- job analyses
- define position
- recruitment
- selecting people
- placement and onboarding
- training and development
- remuneration
- communicate and appraise performance
- evaluate

People do not have concrete measurement statistics, they need to be evaluated differently than products and services.

A complex and difficult task.

### Motivation Theories
Maslow's hierarchy: Bottom to Top list
- adequate compentasion
- job security
- social contacts, team work
- recognition for achievements
- work itself, creativity, responsibility

Work should be a challenge, but not overwhelming.

VRoom's expectancy theory

Do I have the abilities to perform the task?
-> no: no motivation
-> yes: 
	Is it worth the outcome
	-> no: no motivation
	-> yes: Motivation

# Social Matters
### Social Responsibility
Stakeholders:
- Customers
- Suppliers
- Investors
- Governments
- Employees (part of business)

### Corporate Social Responsibility CSR
Topics:
- Sustainability
	- Ecological
	- Cultural
	- Development
- Business Ethics
- Human Rights
- ESG management
- Stakeholder management

EU rules require large companies to publish regular reports on the social and environmental imports of their activities.
https://finance.ec.europa.eu
Directive 2022/2464/EU -> impacting medium and large companies, not just comporations

Part of the non-financial reporting. Used to be called non-financial reporting, now is called sustainability reporting.

More and more companies need to do that in the future too.

Information in reports:
- environmental matters
- social matters 
- treatment of employees
- respect for human rights
- anti-corruption and bribery
- diversity on company boards

> Sustainable development is development that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs

&amp; Cro Harlem Brundtland - Rio Summit 1996

### Sustainable Development Goals
by United Nations

#todo extract to own page

1. No Poverty
2. Zero Hunger
3. good health and well-being
4. quality education
5. gender equality
6. clean water and sanitation

### Business Case for CSR (Caroll 2015)
CSR can help with:
- winning more customers
- relationships with suppliers
- attracting highly qualified workers
- managing risks
- save energy costs (in the long run)
- access to investment and funding opportunities
- business legitimacy and reputation

### Circular Economy
Recycling
- reduce waste
- protect the environment
- boost global competition
- sustainability economic growth
- investment opportunities
- generate new jobs
- save energy
- reduce climate change effects

# Goals of Speckbacher
- fundamental problems that management theory addresses
- why we need theories of management
- "theory building" and how to apply theories to practical problems
- orientation in business and economics
- basic general education in management
- Do I like management studies? What jobs are right for me?
- business administration is exciting, challenging and useful

# Doings Business
## Decision Making View
- basics
	- Scarcity 
	- Tradeoffs
- Consumer Choice
	- how can I receive the best value for my resources (money mostly)?
- production decisions
	- (business) how can I best provide value to my customers?

both in consumer choice and production decisions tradeoffs play a key role.
## Behavior View
> satisficing behavior: people lack information, skills and time to make optimal decisions, they make decisions that are satisfactory

Herbert A Simon: Bounded Rationality
example hiring decisions: I stop hiring, when I found a "good" person, not the best person 

> the stakeholders of a business try to advance their own interests. Goals and decisions in companies are influenced by politics, where stakeholders from coalitions, negotiate, defend their interests...

Richart M. Cyert and James G. March: Behavioral Theory of the Firm

> what stakeholders contribute to the organization depends on what they expect to get in return (salary, job-related training, networks, ...)

> Organizations can only survive if there is an equilibrium between stakeholders' contributions and their expected returns, as incentives to make these contributions

Chester Barnard: Barnard-Simon Theory of Organizational Equilibrium
## Innovation view
- producer surplus/rent vs consumer surplus/rent
	- Iphone X production cost: 350, selling price 1.000
	- Apple made 650 profit per phone
- producers were prepared to pay 1.500
	- these producers have a surplus of 500

- producers only produce products with a selling price greater than the production price
- customers only buy products with a lower selling price than the value they receive from the product

> Innovation is the implementation of creative ideas for (sustainable) win-win situations between the stakeholders of a company.

> Innovations overcome tradeoffs trough creativity!
> Having the cake and eating it too!
# Entrepreneurial Perspective
## Examples of successful entrepeneurs
- Henry Ford
- Ray Kroc (McDonalds)
- Dietrich Mateschitz
- Steve Jobs

> Competitors that do the exact same thing are not dangerous.
> Competitors that do something better are dangerous.

&amp; Speckbacher, 2023

> death is very likely the single best invention of life. It is lifes change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new

&amp; Steve Jobs, 2005
### Common traits
- idea / vision
- something new
	- marketing strategy
	- distribution channels
	- better execution
	- recombination
	- technical invention
- willing to go the extra mile
- content-related goals
- not profit-oriented at first
- plenty consumers, adequate price
	- not just something new and better
- bearing risk of failure

## Joseph Schumpeter
- dynamic entrepreneur / pioneer
	- developing new process or products
	- advantage over competition or new markets
- pioneering entrepreneurs are imitated/copied by others frequently
- process of creative destruction
	- creating something new will always lead to the death of other things
- recombinant innovation
	- new combinations instead of new technologies

Two Types of entrepeneurs
- Pioneers (First Movers)
- Imitators

## Disruption
- disruptive innovation: displacing an existing technology, product, service
	- Smartphones as software platform -> mobile phones (Nokia, Blackberry)
	- Uber -> taxi companies
	- Netflix -> video store
	- Airbnb -> agent/hotels
	- Spotify -> labels / music stores
	- Steam -> game stores
- business model innovation: an innovation if the business model, not the product
	- Nespresso -> cheap machine, expensive coffee
	- Spotify -> free music through ads
	- Youtube -> platform for ads with free videos

> Necessity is the mother of invention

## Supplier Rent Generation / Distribution
Outsourcing
- IBM Modularity
	- Processor produced by Intel
	- Software developed by Microsoft
	- Graphic Cards by nVidia
	- etc

Value generation/distribution shared between many companies, each specializing into a key technology.

IBM, even tho the main innovators, have not gotten much profit. The profiting companies were Intel and Microsoft.

Business Today is mostly done in Platforms. IBM has failed to create a good platform for monetizing their innovation. How can I protect my piece of the cake?

## Smart Rent Generation
Agency Business Model

- get 10.000
- pay freelancer 4.000
- pay for office 1.100
- pay for software 800
---
result: 4.100 Profit for doing basically nothing

most businesses don't have their own office space, it is rented from office space providers (including computers, furniture, etc)

### Consumer Rent
Consumer would have payed at most 15.000 (this is the "worth" of the service)
Consumer only payed 10.000 -> 5.000 consumer rent

### Laborer Rent
Opportunity Cost with different employer: 2.500
Freelancer received 4.000 -> 1.500 laborer rent

### Supplier Rent (office)
office space could not have been rented for the exact same price to another company. This does not produce rent, but still profit, as the renting itself is profitable

### Supplier Rent (software) 
Software has no "production cost" -> duplication is free (just the development is pricy). Any price above 0 is a profit for the developers. 
Received 800 -> 800 Supplier Rent

### Producer Rent
her tasks: 
- taking the risk of failure
- negotiating contracts

Producer Rent from above: 4.100
Reduce by opportunity cost of her time 200 per hour
4.100 - 3 hours * 200 = 3.500

value of risks has to be specified differently, there is no easy way to put a discrete value on the risks she has taken.

> Generating the Value is not hard. Getting your share of the Value generated is hard.

### Value Generation
> The value a business creates for its stakeholders equals the customer value of products minus the value of the contributions made by all stakeholders needed for generating the product.

Value generated is a subjective value. It is how happy the customer is with the result. 
- In this case the value generated is 10.800 (15.000 - 2.500 - 1.100 - 600) 
- (Value of customer) - (Costs of Stakeholders)
- Each participant (also customer) can increase his share (piece of pie) by negotiating for more money (or a lower price)
- The total value generated (size of pie) is driven by entrepreneur
- The total value generated (size of pie) can be increased by adding value for the customer
- Value generated for the customer (10.800) is subjective, nice things -> nice value

It is more successful to have a small piece of a huge pie rather than having a large piece of a smaller pie. Growing the pie is more important than distributing the pie.

### Value Generation through Innovation
> How can we make the business even more innovative and generate more value for all stakeholders?

- User Innovation: enable users/customers to make suggestions on how the product can be made more valuable. Possibility to further develop or customize the software. 
- Employee Innovation: encourage the freelancer to innovate together with the customers and software developers.
- Insight Innovation: Creating a Database with customer experiences to generate unique knowledge. Possibility to develop own software

Most companies have "Intrapreneurships" ... when you have a great idea you get a budget and can try out your great idea.  

# Financial perspective
Important Stuff to know
- Balance Sheets
- Bookkeeping
- Cost/Profit Statement

## Key Questions
- how to measure financial business performance?
- how to measure the value of a company?
- how to ensure liquidity/solvency?
- how to decide on investments?

## Example Taxi OPC
- Lena wants to become a entrepreneur
	- has no idea what to do
	- wants to work her own hours and earn as much money as possible
- Lena has some money (investments)
- Lena wants to provide value to customers
	- Lena finds out about the revenue of a taxi driver from a friend
	- After many conversations she can expect 3.000 monthly **revenue**
	- she can expect 500 monthly **ongoing expenditures**
	- **operating cash** flow is 2.500
- But what about the car?
	- 40.000 upfront is a great **capital expenditure** (**CAPEX**)
	- paid once ... then just used for several years
	- an **investment** into an asset
	- after 5 years the care will be worth 15.000 (willhaben)
	- in 5 years a comparable car will cost 45.000 (market trend)
	  -> + 5.000 inflation over 5 years
	- 40.000 - 15.000 + 5.000 = 30.000 **depreciation** over 5 years

**Depreciation** ... Loss of Value, Loss of Wealth due to time/usage
**straight line depreciation** ... each year the same amount of depreciation

## Cash Flow Statement
#todo get from slides

**net cash flow** after year 1: - 10.000 
**net cash flow** after year 2: 30.000 
year 3 & 4 are like year 2: 30.000
year 5: **net cash flow**: 0

**Free cash flow**: 80.000 over 5 years

Free cash flow = operating cashflow + cashflow from investing (or forecast)
Why free? Because you are free to use it, money from a bank loan is not free to use

## Income Statement
Profit vs Loss Statement

Don't think about how much money left the bank account, but how many resources you have used. Spreading the cost of the taxi (25.000) on all 5 years instead of just the first year.

**Expenditure** ... Paying for something (Fueling car)
**Expense** ... Using up resources (Driving car)

**Depreciation** is an **Expense**.

Profit/Loss Statements produce values over a specific time range (Quarter, Year, Month)

**Cost of sales method**:
Profit is the monetary value of the goods **sold** minus the monetary value of the resources that have been consumed.

**Cost of production method**:
Profit is the monetary value of the goods **produced** minus the monetary resources of the resources that have been consumed.

Profit of each year: 
Revenue - ongoing Expenditures - Expenses (Depreciation) = 25.000 

## Balance Sheet
Which assets and debt do I have? How rich (wealth) am I?

**Assets** right, **Claims** left
Assets - Claims = 0

**Net Worth** ... Assets - Liabilities

### Assets
Assets are split into 
- Non-Current Assets (stays in the company for long duration)
- Current Assets (short-term assets)

### Claims
- Equity (net-worth in the beginning of the year)
- Profit
- Liabilities

## Financial Ratios
### ROI
Return on Investment
ROI = Profit / Invested Capital

How much money do I get back for my investments
### ROCE
ROCE = EBIT / Capital Employed

Capital Employed $\neq$ Invested Capital
ROCE is mostly calculated for special use-cases. So the Capital Employed will be different for each use-case

ROCE = operating profit / operating assets

How much do I make with this operation / use-case
### ROE
Return on Equity
ROE = Profit / Equity

How much do I (the owner, the company) get back for my investments
### Profit Margin
PM = Profit / Revenues

How much profit do I make per sale.
### Liquidity Ratio
LR = Current Assets / short-term liabilities

### Gearing
G = Debt / Equity

debt to equity ratio, leverage ratio
Gearing of 1 ... 50% equity, 50% liabilities

## Corporate Finance
turning an investment into a [[Cash Flow]] Stream
- cash out flow -> the investment (buying a new machine)
- cash in flow -> increased production/sales -> increased cash flow

> When a company has liabilities and equity it is impossible to tell which investment is funded by which.

All Claims are equal, whether equity or liabilities.

### Decisions
- Financing Decisions -> Where is the money coming from?
- Investment Decisions -> What am I gonna use the money for?
	- shareholders need to be pleased

### Analysis of Stocks
[[Market Analysis]]
- How is the whole industry developing?
- How will the specific company develop relative to the industry?
- Will the company have any interesting developments in the future?

## Value of a Company
The value of a company is rarely put together with simple step-by-step calculations. It is mostly a combination of many factors.  It is mostly about how much the company will yield to investors in the future, not necessarily about how much the company is "worth" right now.
### Sheet Logic Value
Assets - Liabilities = Equity

this is incomplete to what the company will be worth and a buying decision should not be made just by the [[Balance Sheet]].

### Economic Value
The Value is determined by the future prospects of earnings or cash flow from this company

Factors are
- Management -> C-Level leaving/dying
- Research -> e.g. Pharma and Bio Tech huge impact
- [[Intangible Assets]] -> dependent on company
- [[Interlectual Property]] -> dependent on company
 
### Shares Value
[[Market Capitalization]]

### Forecast Value
Investors only interested in future profits
Generating forecasts on how the company is going to perform

Attaching a monetary value to a [[Cash Flow]] Stream

Money of the future in comparison to today.

### Discounting
Calculations done without [[Risks]].

She sum of discounted future cash flows $CF_t$ more than the investment $I$?
$NPV=-I +\frac{CF_1}{1+r}+\frac{CF_2}{(1+r)^2}+\frac{CF_3}{(1+r)^3} +... +\frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$; $NPV>0$ -> $(-I, CF_1, CF_2, CF_3, ..., CF_t)$ is a profitable investment
$r$ ... discount rate
$NPV$ ... [[Net Present Value]]
#### Example Taxi
Assumption: the taxi business is closed after 5 years

 $-40,000 +  \frac {30,000}{1+r} + \frac {30,000}{(1+r)^2} + \frac {30,000}{(1+r)^3} + \frac {30,000}{(1+r)^4} + \frac {45,000}{(1+r)^5}= 1001,637$ 
 for $r=0.05$

The [[Net Present Value]] is positive, it would be a worthwhile investment.

Careful: This price also includes the driving of the taxi (done by entrepreneur).

After hiring a taxi driver for 24k per year:
 $-40,000 +  \frac {6,000}{1+r} + \frac {6,000}{(1+r)^2} + \frac {6,000}{(1+r)^3} + \frac {6,000}{(1+r)^4} + \frac {21,000}{(1+r)^5}= -2.270$ 
 for $r=0.05$

The [[Net Present Value]] now is negative. This would not be a good investment. You would get more money just saving with the bank at 5%.

#### 0 Discount Rate
when solving the $NPV = 0$ for $r$ we can find the [[Internal Rate of Return]]. 

Invest 200 now, get 220 in a year: $\frac{220}{200} - 1 = 10\%$

But how can we solve for $r$ in more years than just 2? -> [[Newtons Approximation]]
Basically brute force the values.

After brute forcing we get $0.032 < r < 0.033$ for this specific problem.

### Amortization
How long is the investment going to take to pay for itself?

Either by cutting costs or increasing sales.

### Putting it all together
- predict future [[Cash Flow]]s
- define [[Profitability]], what counts towards profit
- [[Discounting|discount]] them with current interest rates
- is expected to be close to the [[Market Capitalization]]
- there is no "correct" way of calculating the value
- other factors: 
	- income taxes
	- information of investors, providers of debt or other stakeholders
	- measuring and managing the financial performance of the company
- everything is just approximation

# Strategic Perspective
### What is Strategy?

> How to avoid competition

- Rumble in the Jungle 1974
	- World Boxing championship
	- Muhammad Ali and George Foreman 
	- Muhammad Ali banned bc of Vietnam War and Black Rights
	- Muhammad Ali not in his peak performance


> Float like a butterfly - Sting like a bee

&amp; Muhammad Ali

Muhammad Ali's Strategy was to tire George Foreman so much, that in the end he could defeat George Foreman. He was applying his strengths while protecting against his weaknesses. Based on this strategy he trained to support his strategy.

## Strategies
### Price Leadership
providing the same product for a much cheaper price
[[USP]]: the cheapest option
### Product Innovation
being the "original" or the first on the market
[[USP]]: the first product or only product for some time
### Quality Leadership
the brand or the quality of the product is unique enough to create value 
[[USP]]: best product / provides most value
### Niche Leadership
such a "small" market that nobody else wants to participate
[[USP]]: only product available
## Market Barriers
### Market Saturation Barrier
- A saturated market is harder to join in on
- Competitors can still join in markets which are not as separated
	- Red Bull in EU market
	- Monster in US market
### Initial Investment Barrier
- a high investment for any competitors to build up a brand similar to the original
### Innovation Barrier
- it is just too hard to join the race because the innovation costs are so high
	- Apple with its M2 chips
### Patent Barrier
- you can't use my technology or I'll sue you
	- pharma is big with patents
## Market-Based View
- from [[Michael Porter]] (Harvard)
- [[Competitive Advantage]]
	- choose an attractive market
	- establish [[#Market Barriers]] -> me no like competition
-  Multiple brands for multiple markets
- Volkswagen
	- normal Golf -> low price
	- Lamborghini -> brand
	- Porsche -> quality
## Resource-Based View
- from [[Edith Penrose]]
- competitive edge being unique access to resources
- they need to be [[VRIO Resources]]
- what about basic resources?
	- Apples -> every apple is mostly the same
		- Organic Farming
		- Special Breeds (maybe old/forgotten breeds)
		- Special Marketing (CO2-free Apples)
## Personal Career Strategy
> University is not about what you get taught. It's about what you learn about yourself.

&amp; [[Speckbacher]]

- personal Strengths and Weaknesses -> [[#Resource-Based View]]
	- what am I good at?
	- what can I improve?
- personal Opportunities and Threats -> [[#Market-Based View]]
	- what is demanded on the job market?
	- what is an attractive job market for me?

Travel, do internships, talk with people, find out what people need/want.

> Focus on your strengths, don't worry about your weaknesses.

&amp; [[Speckbacher]]
